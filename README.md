# Grocery-List-tracker
This was a School project that I worked on in a previous college class.  We were asked to read a text file and extract the data within the file.  We were asked to print the grocery items and the number of each item into a list with the name of the item and the number.  We were also asked to compete a histogram based on the item and item count.  This program utilized the map function in c++ mapping a string which is the item name and an integer which is the items frequency.  The program would open the file and extract the information.  Then a seperate function to save the file and map the contents to the item count was created and then there were 2 other functions that printed the histogram and the list of items and their repsected frequencies.  

This project demonstrates the ability to create functions in C++ as well as read and extract data from a text file.  The data is then manipulated to our needs and is displayed to the user based off of their menu choice.  This project also utilizes a menu that takes input that can lead to different tasks being completed based off of user choice.
